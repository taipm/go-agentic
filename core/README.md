## 🎯 What is go-agentic?

go-agentic is a **next-generation multi-agent framework** that lets you build sophisticated AI systems where multiple specialized agents work together to solve complex problems. Unlike traditional single-agent systems, go-agentic enables:

- **Agent Collaboration** - Agents communicate and hand off work intelligently
- **Intelligent Routing** - Problems are routed to the right agent based on analysis
- **Real-time Streaming** - Watch agents work in real-time via your browser or CLI
- **Interactive Workflows** - Pause and ask for clarification without losing context
- **Complete Feedback** - Multi-round execution where agents see tool results

This is what modern AI systems look like - not a single powerful agent, but a team of specialized agents working together.

**Architecture is now modular with clear separation of concerns. See [REFACTORING_STATUS.md](../REFACTORING_STATUS.md) for migration progress.**

## Phase 4: Workflow & Executor Extraction (Recent)

As of December 2025, Phase 4 of the architectural refactoring is complete. Two new packages have been extracted to improve modularity:

### New Packages (Phase 4)

**`/workflow`** - Workflow Orchestration & Handler Pattern

- `handler.go` - OutputHandler interface with multiple implementations:
  - `SyncHandler` - Synchronous execution (buffers events)
  - `StreamHandler` - Real-time streaming (channel-based)
  - `NoOpHandler` - Testing helper
- `execution.go` - Workflow execution with ExecutionContext for state tracking
- `routing.go` - Agent routing logic (DetermineNextAgent, RouteBySignal, etc.)

**`/executor`** - Crew Execution Orchestration

- `executor.go` - Main Executor struct with:
  - `Execute()` - Synchronous execution
  - `ExecuteStream()` - Streaming execution
  - Resume capability for interrupted workflows
  - Verbose logging support

### Impact

- Reduced executor coupling from 85/100 → 50/100
- Handler pattern enables pluggable output strategies
- Clear separation of workflow orchestration from crew management
- All tests passing with zero regressions

**For detailed information:** See [PHASE_4_COMPLETION_REPORT.md](../PHASE_4_COMPLETION_REPORT.md)

## Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Provider LLM Support**

go-agentic now supports multiple LLM providers through a unified abstraction layer:

- **Ollama** (Recommended for Development)
  - Free and open-source models
  - Run locally without API keys
  - Models: deepseek-r1:1.5b (default), gemma3:1b, llama3.1:8b, etc.
  - Perfect for testing and local development

- **OpenAI** (Production-Ready)
  - Enterprise-grade language models
  - Native tool calling support
  - Models: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o
  - Best for production deployments

**Switch providers by updating your YAML configuration - no code changes needed!**

See [Provider Guide](../docs/PROVIDER_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### 2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
```
User Input
  ↓
Orchestrator (entry point, decides routing)
  ↓
Clarifier (gathers info if needed)
  ↓
Executor (terminal agent, performs diagnostics with tools)
  ↓
Final Response
```

### 3. **Complete Feedback Loop**
- Agents receive tool execution results
- Multi-round execution (not single-pass)
- Context preservation across interactions

### 4. **8 Pre-built IT Support Tools**
- `GetCPUUsage()` - CPU usage percentage
- `GetMemoryUsage()` - Memory utilization
- `GetDiskSpace(path)` - Disk space by path
- `GetSystemInfo()` - OS, hostname, uptime
- `GetRunningProcesses(count)` - Top running processes
- `PingHost(host, count)` - Network connectivity
- `CheckServiceStatus(service)` - Service status
- `ResolveDNS(hostname)` - DNS resolution

### 5. **Safety Mechanisms**
- MaxHandoffs: Prevents infinite loops (default: 5)
- Terminal agents: Executor guaranteed final agent
- Input validation on all tools

### 6. **Real-Time Streaming**
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live agent execution
- Watch agents work in real-time
- Beautiful web UI client included

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
cd go-crewai
go mod download
```

### 2. Set API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 3. Run Example

```bash
go run ./cmd

# Try commands like:
# "Check my system health"
# "Why is my CPU high?"
# "Is nginx running?"
```

### 4. Build Binary

```bash
go build -o go-crewai-example ./cmd
./go-crewai-example
```

## Core API Usage

### Creating Agents

```go
import "github.com/taipm/go-crewai"

// Create a crew with agents
crew := crewai.CreateITSupportCrew()

// Create executor
executor := crewai.NewCrewExecutor(crew, apiKey)

// Execute with user input
ctx := context.Background()
response, err := executor.Execute(ctx, "Check my system")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Agent: %s\n", response.AgentName)
fmt.Printf("Response: %s\n", response.Content)
```

### Creating Custom Agents

```go
agent := &crewai.Agent{
    ID:          "my-agent",
    Name:        "My Custom Agent",
    Role:        "Description of agent's role",
    Backstory:   "Agent's background and expertise",
    Model:       "gpt-4o",
    Tools:       []*crewai.Tool{},
    Temperature: 0.7,
    IsTerminal:  true, // Last agent in workflow
}
```

### Creating Custom Tools

```go
tool := &crewai.Tool{
    Name:        "MyTool",
    Description: "What this tool does",
    Parameters: map[string]interface{}{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": map[string]interface{}{
            "param1": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "description": "First parameter",
            },
        },
    },
    Handler: func(ctx context.Context, args map[string]interface{}) (string, error) {
        // Tool implementation
        return "Result from tool", nil
    },
}

agent.Tools = append(agent.Tools, tool)
```

## Workflow Example

### Input: "My machine is running slow"

```
[Orchestrator]: Analyzing the issue... I need more information about the machine.

[Clarifier]: Which machine are you referring to? Please provide the IP address or hostname.

User: 192.168.1.100

[Executor - ROUND 1]:
  I'll check the system health starting with CPU and memory.
  GetCPUUsage()

[Tool Result]:
  CPU: 92% (high)

[Executor - ROUND 2]:
  CPU is high. Let me check memory usage.
  GetMemoryUsage()

[Tool Result]:
  Memory: 88% (high)

[Executor - ROUND 3]:
  Both CPU and memory are high. Let me see the running processes.
  GetRunningProcesses(10)

[Tool Result]:
  Top 10 processes listed...

[Executor - Final]:
  ✅ Analysis Complete:

  Your machine is slow due to:
  1. High CPU usage (92%)
  2. High memory usage (88%)
  3. 3 database processes consuming most resources

  Recommendations:
  - Increase RAM (currently at 88% utilization)
  - Optimize database queries
  - Consider adding CPU resources
  - Kill unnecessary processes: [PID LIST]
```

## Architecture Improvements Over v3.0.3

| Aspect | v3.0.3 | go-crewai | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Tool execution rounds | 1 only ❌ | ∞ until done ✅ | Complete feedback loop |
| Handoff limit | Ignored ❌ | Enforced ✅ | Safety guaranteed |
| Terminal agent | Ignored ❌ | Enforced ✅ | Clean exit |
| Error recovery | None ❌ | Suggestions ✅ | Graceful degradation |
| Library dependency | agent-sdk-go ⚠️ | openai-go ✅ | Full control |
| **Completeness** | **50%** | **95%** | **Complete** |

## Configuration

### Crew Settings

```go
crew := &crewai.Crew{
    Agents:      agents,
    MaxRounds:   10,      // Max tool execution rounds
    MaxHandoffs: 5,       // Max agent handoffs
}
```

## System Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- OpenAI API key (gpt-4o access)
- System tools available: `ping`, `df`, `ps`, `hostname`, `nslookup`, etc.

## Dependencies

```

2. Single conversation session (no persistent memory)
3. No tool prioritization

### Future Enhancements
1. Proper OpenAI tool-calling API integration
2. Conversation history persistence
3. Tool cost tracking
4. Shared memory between agents
